# Welcome to my profile

Hi! My name is Carter, I am a student studying Comp Sci. and hope to build cool stuff!

I mainly enjoy working with Typescript, React, Next.js, and am an avid fan of Firebase.

My current project is https://ferris.gg/

I am also looking for a job! Feel free to reach out if interested.

Thanks!
